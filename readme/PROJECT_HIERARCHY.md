## Description of Components

* **`news_reporter/`**: The root directory for the project.
* **`news_reporter_env/`**: Contains the isolated Python virtual environment. This should be excluded from version control (added to `.gitignore`).
* **`readme/`**: Contains Markdown files providing documentation about the project.
* **`.env`**: A file (not tracked by Git) to store sensitive API keys (`TAVILY_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
* **`.gitignore`**: Standard Git file to specify files/directories that Git should ignore (e.g., `news_reporter_env/`, `.env`, `*.docx`, `__pycache__/`).
* **`main.py`**: The core script that performs searching, formatting, generation, and printing.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project. Used by `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* **`*.docx`**: The output report files generated by the script (e.g., `local_news.docx`). These are typically excluded from version control.
