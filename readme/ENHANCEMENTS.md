# Potential Enhancements

This document lists potential areas for future improvement and feature additions to the Automated News Reporter project.

## 1. Configuration & Customization

* **External Configuration:** Move hardcoded values like search queries, OpenAI model selection (`gpt-4o`), and potentially prompt templates into a separate configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`, `config.json`). This makes customization easier without modifying the script code.
* **Command-Line Arguments:** Use `argparse` to allow users to specify parameters like the configuration file path, specific news levels to run, or an output directory when running the script.
* **Customizable Prompts:** Allow the user to define or modify the OpenAI prompt structure via the configuration file.

## 2. Output & Formatting

* **Advanced DOCX Formatting:** Utilize more features of the `python-docx` library (styles, tables, specific heading levels based on AI output) to create more professionally formatted documents instead of a single text block. This might require parsing the AI's output if it uses Markdown or other delimiters.
* **Alternative Output Formats:** Add options to generate reports in other formats like Markdown (`.md`), PDF, or plain text (`.txt`).
* **Report Archiving:** Implement a system to save generated reports into dated subdirectories (e.g., `reports/YYYY-MM-DD/`) to keep outputs organized.

## 3. Robustness & Error Handling

* **Specific Exception Handling:** Replace generic `except Exception:` blocks with more specific exception types (`requests.RequestException`, `openai.APIError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `subprocess.CalledProcessError`, etc.) for more targeted error messages and potential recovery logic (e.g., retries).
* **Logging:** Replace `print` statements with Python's standard `logging` module. This allows for different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR), outputting to files, and better log management.
* **Input Validation:** Add validation for configuration file contents or command-line arguments.
* **API Key Check:** Re-implement the check after `load_dotenv()` to ensure API keys are actually loaded before attempting to use them, providing a clearer error message if `.env` is missing or incomplete.

## 4. Printing

* **Cross-Platform Printing Libraries:** Investigate dedicated Python libraries for printing (though these can be complex and platform-dependent) for potentially more reliable results than relying solely on `os.startfile` or `lp`.
* **Printer Selection:** Allow the user to specify a target printer instead of always using the system default.
* **Print Job Status:** Explore ways to get feedback on whether the print job was successfully submitted or if it failed at the printer level (this is often difficult).

## 5. User Experience

* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Create a simple GUI using libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy to allow users to configure settings, trigger the report generation, and view status/logs more easily.
* **Web Interface:** Develop a web application using Flask or Streamlit to provide a browser-based interface for the tool.

## 6. Performance & Cost

* **Caching:** Implement caching for API search results (e.g., for a short duration) to potentially reduce redundant API calls if the script is run frequently.
* **Model Selection:** Allow choosing less expensive/faster OpenAI models via configuration if GPT-4o is not strictly necessary for certain tasks.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** For GUIs or web interfaces, consider using `asyncio` to perform API calls and file operations without blocking the main thread.
